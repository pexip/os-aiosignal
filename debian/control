Description: manage callbacks in asyncio projects
 Signal is a list of registered asynchronous callbacks.
 .
 The signal's life-cycle has two stages: after creation its content
 could be filled by using standard list operations: `sig.append()` etc.
 .
 After you call `sig.freeze()` the signal is frozen: adding, removing
 and dropping callbacks is forbidden.
 .
 The only available operation is calling the previously registered
 callbacks by using `await sig.send(data)`.
